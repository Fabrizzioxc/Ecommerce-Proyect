# FlowbiteBlazorWasmStarter

# Overview

This template is made to speed up the process of setting up Tailwind CSS and Flowbite in a Blazor WebAssembly project so that you can begin developing
your Blazor apps much more quickly while having all the redundant setup work being taken care of.
The default non-empty Blazor templates come equipped with Bootstrap. However, this template replaces Bootstrap with Tailwind CSS, and in addition to that, it instals Flowbite, which is an open-source, free to use UI components library built on top of Tailwind CSS, the library has a plethora of well-designed, mobile-responive and fully interactive components that you can use to build your applications.
